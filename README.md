# 434Project2.2
Used last project as a template for this, I want to change the tabs a bit to make them look better but otherwise I think this should work.

If you guys think of any tasks please add them, we want a lot of features so we have a buffer if grading doesnt approve of one or two of them.


Task List:
- example task (page responsible for task e.g. main, goals, log/input, history, settings)

Shallow Tasks:
- Switch progress ring view to a timeline (main)
- Switch tabs? (all tabs)
- View Achievements (main)
- View Purchase History (history)
- View Current Goal (goals)

Medium Tasks:
- quick add expense (main)
- view expenses of a category over time (history) this could be expanded on
- add income and categorize (log)
- potential: search achievements by a category or alphabetically (main)
- add achievement icon to home page (main)

Deep Tasks:
- add new goal or update goal (goals)
- add recurring expense (log)
- add recurring income (log)
-
